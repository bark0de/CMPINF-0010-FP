We are group 7 on canvas, the (Insert group name here)!

We have sought out to find the best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh using different datasets from the Western Pennsylvainia Regional Database. We have used Poverty.csv, (Dataset 2), and (Dataset 3). We have combined all these datasets to create the metric (insert metric), which will be scaled from 0-100, which will be used to grade all of the communities of Pittsburgh.

Summary 1:
Poverty.csv contains estimates of how many households within each neighborhood are below the poverty level. First, we looked at the total number of households in each neighborhood that were in poverty. The logic being that a neighborhood with a large amount of households in poverty might not be the best place to live. This is not a good measure however, as the number of households in poverty is relative to the number of people in the community. This led us to use the poverty rate as our metric for ranking pittsburgh communities by poverty level. By using poverty rate, we are able to objectively analyze how impoverished a community is by their proportion of households in poverty divided by the total number of households within the community.
