We have sought out to find the best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh using different datasets from the Western Pennsylvainia Regional Database. We have used data related to poverty, arrests, and resturant inspection violations. We have combined all these datasets to create the metric "liveability", which will be scaled from 0-100 and will be used to grade all of the communities of Pittsburgh.

## Which Pittsburgh neighborhood is the most liveable?
Our project looks to answer that by analyzing datasets that yield information related to aspects of living.

Dataset 1: [Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data/resource/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f)

Dataset consisting of arrest informations pertaining to anonymous individuals arrested by the Pittsburgh Police between 2016-2023. 

Dataset 2: [Poverty Rates](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2014-miscellaneous-data/resource/7996d143-c155-466e-8414-115f74997dd7)

Poverty.csv contains estimates of how many households within each neighborhood are below the poverty level. First, we looked at the total number of households in each neighborhood that were in poverty. The logic being that a neighborhood with a large amount of households in poverty might not be the best place to live. This is not a good measure however, as the number of households in poverty is relative to the number of people in the community. This led us to use the poverty rate as our metric for ranking pittsburgh communities by poverty level. By using poverty rate, we are able to objectively analyze how impoverished a community is by their proportion of households in poverty divided by the total number of households within the community.

Dataset 3: [Food Facility/Restaurant Inspection Violations](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-restaurant-food-facility-inspection-violations/resource/1a1329e2-418c-4bd3-af2c-cc334e7559af)

Dataset consisting of every instance in which a restaurant or food facility in Pittsburgh had at least one violation during routine inspections.

Dataset 4: [Neighborhoods](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2)

Geospatial representation of the neighborhoods we want to analyze.
