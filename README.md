We have sought out to find the best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh using different datasets from the Western Pennsylvainia Regional Database. We have used data related to poverty, arrests, and resturant inspection violations. We have combined all of these datasets to create the metric "liveability", which is ranked by adding each individual neighborhood's rank in all 3 datasets together.

## Which Pittsburgh neighborhood is the most liveable?
Our project looks to answer that by analyzing datasets that yield information related to aspects of living.

Dataset 1: [Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data/resource/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f)

Dataset consisting of arrest informations pertaining to anonymous individuals arrested by the Pittsburgh Police between 2016-2023. 

Dataset 2: [Poverty Rates](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2014-miscellaneous-data/resource/7996d143-c155-466e-8414-115f74997dd7)

This dataset contains estimates of how many households within each neighborhood are below the poverty level.

Dataset 3: [Food Facility/Restaurant Inspection Violations](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-restaurant-food-facility-inspection-violations/resource/1a1329e2-418c-4bd3-af2c-cc334e7559af)

Dataset consisting of every instance in which a restaurant or food facility in Pittsburgh had at least one violation during routine inspections.

Dataset 4: [Neighborhoods](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2)

Geospatial representation of the neighborhoods we want to analyze.

Conclusion:

We combined these datasets to produce one final ranking for each neighborhood in Pittsburgh under
